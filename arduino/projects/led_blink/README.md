LED Blink Project
This is my first Arduino project

In this project, I experimented with:
- Synchronous blinking (both LEDs together)
- Alternating blinking (LEDs opposite to each other)
- Different delay intervals

What I did
- Blinked the built-in LED
- Connected **two physical LEDs** to pins 12 and 8
- Changed delay timings independently
- Tested multiple blink patterns

What I learned
- pinMode()
- digitalWrite()
- delay()
- Basic timing differences
- Running multiple LEDs together

Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno
- 2 LEDs
- 2 Resistors (180Ω)
- Breadboard + jumper wires
